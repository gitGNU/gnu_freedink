Future
======

mode is not initialized in dinkvar.h.
It is, I think, first initialized in dink.cpp in doInit().
process_line() from dinkvar.h also set its value.


At a point, mode needs to be properly initialized somewhere, to avoid
"duplicating" the variable in each object file that uses it.


When sprites are disabled for N minutes with editor_type(), the 'N
minutes' are computed with the value SDL_GetTicks() the last time you
entered the screen. This can be a problem:

- Generally: the last_time per-screen value is reset each time the
  screen is loaded. This means that if you enter a screen once every 5
  minutes, the counter will always be reset, and you'll never see
  enemies reappearing. This is more complex to fix, as it probably
  requires altering the savegame format.

- SDL-specific: if you quit and restart the game, then SDL_GetTicks is
  reset. In the woe version, you needed to reboot the computer (not
  the game) to get the same effect. So maybe we can check if N minutes
  passed using a timestamp instead.


Warn if a savegame appears to be v1.08 while running in v1.07 mode.

i18n
====

[ ] Use a relocatable LOCALEDIR

[ ] Fall back to main Dink .mo if no translations are found

[ ] Try to open files from l10n/LOCALE/ in case the translation is
    providing a graphic or script replacement

[ ] Have DFArc look at l10n/LOCALE/dmod.diz if available
    => No, rather add dmod.diz to the .pot file, so translators have
    as much text as possible in their .po file.

[ ] Unbreakable spaces are displayed with a square. This breaks the
    use of unbreakable spaces in front of punctuation in translations
    (e.g. for French '!'). This is a problem in either Liberation-Sans
    or SDL_ttf. OOo can display correct unbreakable spaces with
    Liberation-Sans though.


SDL 1.3
=======

As of 2010-11-01

[ ] Fix relative mouse movements in the title screen

[ ] Set window caption and icon

[ ] Fix fade to black - too fast(?) in non-truecolor mode
    Actually, it takes the same amount of frames (exactly 5), but I
    guess that the palette issue below makes is far less striking.

[ ] Fix fade to black - white pixels palette mess E.g.: fade_down()
    when going out of Dink's house Looks like there's a pixels palette
    conversion during the backbuffer->frontbuffer blit, instead of a
    plain palette index substitution :/  Possibly an issue in the SDL
    1.3 compatibility mode; indeed, SDL_SetPalette now ignores the
    'flags' (SDL_LOGPAL / SDL_PHYSPAL) entirely.

[ ] Fix FreeDinkedit text input

[ ] Unfinished: alpha support in gfx_blit_nocolorkey

[ ] Fix fullscreen toggle

[X] Wrong Pulseaudio detection [reported]
