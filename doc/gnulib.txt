Gnulib is a set of C snipets that provide a portable implementation of
common C functions and symbols (such as strdup, getopt, etc.). When
you include one in your project, it is used as fallback if the host
implementation does not exist or is broken.

This permits to rely on standard and stable C functions.

Initial import:
/usr/src/gnulib/gnulib-tool \
  --source-base=gnulib/lib --m4-base=gnulib/m4 \
  --import

Then follow the manual and instructions from gnulib-tool (changes are
scattered among the autotools build system files).

We use the getopt module (for getopt_long()) and the relocatable-prog
(get_full_program_name() and relocate()).


To refresh Gnulib, just:
/usr/src/gnulib/gnulib-tool --import

Gnulib will use 'gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4' to detect which modules
need to be updated.


As of May 2012, I reported a bug in 'build-aux/install-reloc'
affecting Debian GNU/Hurd and GNU/kFreeBSD in particular.
A fixed version is available at:
http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2012/05/msg00032.html

Bruno, who is in charge of this script and wrote the fix, will not
commit that fix until he has the time to write a proper test case for
it.  As of December 2012 this remains to be done, so
'build-aux/install-reloc' needs to be overwritten manually before
running 'bootstrap'.

Similarly it seems the 'install-reloc' modules makes a Gnulib test fail:
../../tests/test-fdopendir.c:39:3: error: ‘INSTALLDIR’ undeclared (first use in this function)
consequently Gnulib tests are disabled.

We may consider dropping relocation support to ease the releases.
